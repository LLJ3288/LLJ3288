  ### About Me
  
I have recently completed a 16 week coding bootcamp with Tech Talent South Shreveport that spanned from November 2020 to March 2021. I am currently working on improving my coding knowledge, abilities, and related concepts covered and applied in the program. Iâ€™m looking forward to working in this exciting field and being as asset to any company and team once given the opportunity.
